Create a web application for a typesetting/printing company that optimizes product layout on sheets. Requirements:

1. Core functionality:
   - Allow users to specify sheet dimensions (width and height in mm)
   - Let users add multiple product types with different dimensions and quantities
   - Arrange products on sheets efficiently using a 2D bin packing algorithm
   - Maintain the correct ratio between different product quantities
   - Calculate the minimum number of identical sheets needed
   - Display the optimized layout visually

2. Key information to display:
   - Visual representation of the sheet layout
   - Total number of sheets needed
   - Utilization rate (percentage of sheet area used)
   - Products per sheet (quantity of each type)
   - Total quantities that will be produced (including any extras)

3. Technical implementation:
   - Use React with TypeScript
   - Use canvas-based visualization (react-konva or similar)
   - Optimize placement with edge-based scoring for better packing
   - Ensure consistent layouts across all sheets

The application should follow the principle that all sheets have identical layouts, and the original ratio between product quantities should be maintained as closely as possible to minimize waste.
